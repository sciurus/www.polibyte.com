title:      Two discussions of the internet and campaigns
---


I heard about the first through [IDPI's blog](http://www.ipdi.org/blog/index.php/2007/09/28/new-media-and-the-2008-presidential-election/). It's a a national press club discussion with communication directors from the Giuliani, Romney, Biden and Thompson campaigns; video of the event is available [here](http://www.visualwebcaster.com/event.asp?id=42466) in Windows Media format.

The second discussion was hosted by the E-Voter Institute; the panel includes the internet campaign directors for the RNC and DNC. The discussion was broken into segments and uploaded to Google Video; a list of the clips is available [here](http://guest.cvent.com/EVENTS/Info/Summary.aspx?i=84f1e572-8580-4c05-a614-5a7d725274bd). If you're interested in the results of the Institute's latest survey of consultants and the public, you can download it directly from [here](http://www.evoterinstitute.com/pdfs/EVISurvey07.pdf).
