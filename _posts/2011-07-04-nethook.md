I recently had a [problem](http://serverfault.com/questions/254773/specifying-a-preferred-route-when-there-are-multiple-links-to-same-network) on CentOS 5 where the best solution I could think of required running a command when a network interface is brought up. I'm used to having this functionality as a part of the networking scripts on Debian-derived distributions, but I discovered that Red Hat-derived distributions lack it. I've written a small daemon called nethook to provide it. You can find the code and documentation for [nethook](https///github.com/sciurus/nethook) on github.

Update: Moved project from google code to github.
