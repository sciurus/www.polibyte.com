I dropped in on the Virtual Citizenship | New Technologies Symposium at Wayne State on Friday via Second Life. This was my first time signing on to Second Life 
since 2003. The linux client crashed hard at first, but it worked well after I disabled all OpenGL extensions. Since the video link was one way and very few people attended virtually, I didn't see any benefit to Second Life over standard streaming video.

The conference itself was fascinating. I particularly enjoyed [Fred Stutzman](http://chimprawk.blogspot.com/) and [Vernor Vinge's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernor_Vinge) talks. Kevin Deegan-Kraus [liveblogged](http://www.pozorblog.com/citizenship/index.html) the event. Videos should be available on the [event website](http://www.lib.wayne.edu/virship/) soon.
