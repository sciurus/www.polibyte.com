title:      Web operations conferences
---


Last year I started keeping a list of conferences I was interested in. I had the idea that this might make a good community resource, so today I built [webopsconferences.com](http://www.webopsconferences.com/). The goal is to be an up-to-date, no-frills list of conferences of interest to people working in the field of [web operations](http://omniti.com/seeds/what-is-web-operations). Contributing to it is as simple as editing a YAML file. I hope it's useful to someone!
