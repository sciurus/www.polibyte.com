I published an update to the LibX extension for UGA for the first time in nearly a year today. I did some testing to ensure the basic functionality works. Now that I'm not a regular user of Firefox or UGA's library [0], I can't promise that it wont be another year before I think to publish a new version, or that I'll be motivated to solve any problems that pop up when UGA switches off WebVoyage completely in favor of VuFind. Is anyone else interested in taking this extension over? Thanks to the hard work of the LibX maintainers at Virgina Tech keeping it up to date is an incredibly simple task.

[0] Yes, I finished my MA without blogging about it like I promised. I'll try to rectify that at some point.
