A recent discussion on the Atlanta Linux Enthusiasts mailing list has highlighted that it's not easy to find the systems that Dell sells without Windows. Here are all the desktop and notebook options of which I'm aware.


*  [Desktops and Laptops (Inspiron) with Ubuntu](http://www.dell.com/content/topics/segtopic.aspx/linux_3x?c=us&cs=19&l=en&s=dhs)


*  [Desktops (Inspiron) with FreeDOS](http://www.dell.com/content/topics/segtopic.aspx/e510_nseries?c=us&cs=19&l=en&s=dhs)


*  [Desktops (Precision) with Red Hat](http://www.dell.com/content/products/features.aspx/precn_n?c=us&cs=04&l=en&s=bsd)


*  [Laptops (Latitude) with FreeDOS](http://www.dell.com/content/products/features.aspx/nseries_nb?c=us&cs=04&l=en&s=bsd)


*  [Desktops (Optiplex) with FreeDOS](http://www.dell.com/content/products/features.aspx/optix_n?c=us&cs=04&l=en&s=bsd)


*  [Desktops (Vostro) with FreeDOS](http://www.dell.com/content/products/features.aspx/vostrodt_n?c=us&cs=04&l=en&s=bsd)

I've had one of the Inspiron 1420 notebooks sold with Ubuntu since August and am a satisfied customer. If you're looking for a new laptop, Dell is a [good deal](http://www.ideastorm.com/article/show/66879/Implemented_Ubuntu_Dell_is_50_Less_Than_Windows_Dell).
