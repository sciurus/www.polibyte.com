I had the privilege of presenting on Migrating Applications Without Fear at [PyTennessee 2020](https://2020.pytennessee.org/). My pitch was:

Has your application has been running happily, but now it has to move? From the datacenter to the cloud, or from one cloud provider to another? Fear not! This talk covers strategies for making applications infrastructure-agnostic and handling the organizational challenges of a migration.
