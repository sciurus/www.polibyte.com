title:      Nashville DevOpsDays Thanks
---

When I moved to Nashville in 2014, I had a lot of uncertainty about what the tech scene was like. If you'd told me that within a few years I would be helping to run the city's first DevOpsDays, I'm sure I would have scratched my head in puzzlement. Yet, we just wrapped it up! Much thanks goes out to

* The many [sponsors](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2016-nashville/sponsor/) who supported us
* The talented [speakers](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2016-nashville/program/) who shared their stories
* The Nashville organizers (James Fryman, Jurnell Cockhren, Eliza Marcum, Chris Wage, Nick Wallace) for having the vision and perserverance to put together the many pieces needed to hold the event
* The DevOpsDays core organizer group for their example and assistance
* James for trusting me to build a volunteer team and take care of the event day tasks
* All the volunteers who answered my call to show up early, stay late, and handle all the unglamorous tasks it takes to run a conference

You all did a fantastic job, and I hope we'll work together again next year!
