title:      Packer supports vagrant-libvirt
---


The 0.7.2 release of [Packer](https///www.packer.io/) has a treat for users of [vagrant-libvirt](https///github.com/pradels/vagrant-libvirt). Packer's vagrant post-processor now knows how to generate a box that you can use directly with vagrant-libvirt, no [mutations](https///github.com/sciurus/vagrant-mutate) required! Thanks to [Julian Phillips](https///github.com/qur) for doing the development work and to [Mike Perez](https///github.com/Thingee) and [Wolodja Wentland](https///github.com/babilen) for doing most of the testing.
