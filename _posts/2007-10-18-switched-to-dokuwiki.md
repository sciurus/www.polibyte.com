I've migrated PoliByte from Wordpress and Wikka Wiki to [DokuWiki](http://wiki.splitbrain.org/wiki:dokuwiki). I'm using several plugins by Esther Brunner, most notably her [blog plugin](http://wiki.splitbrain.org/plugin:blog), and Zenwire's [ theme mmKanso](http://www.zenzire.com/mmkanso). I'm doing my best to make sure that no links broke in the process.
