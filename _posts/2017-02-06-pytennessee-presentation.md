I had the privilege of presenting on Capacity and Stability Patterns at [PyTennessee 2017](https://www.pytennessee.org/). My pitch was:

"At Eventbrite, engineers are tasked with building systems that can withstand dramatic spikes in load when popular events go on sale. There are patterns that help us do this. Come learn about these patterns, how Eventbrite has adopted them, and how to implement them within your own code and infrastructure."
