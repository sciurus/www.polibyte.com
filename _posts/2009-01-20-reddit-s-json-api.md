You can find discussions of [ Reddit's](http://www.reddit.com ) "secret" [API](http://code.reddit.com/ticket/154) on a few blogs. Just as interesting, but not discussed on those blogs, is that Reddit will return any page in [ JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON ) format if you append .json to the URL. For example: 


*  [ New items in the Comics category as JSON](http://www.reddit.com/r/comics/new/.json )

*  [ Comments on an item as JSON](http://www.reddit.com/r/comics/comments/7r09q/morning_in_america_comic/.json )
