title:      Calendar of floss events in ga

UPDATE: I realized I was doing a bad job of keeping this calendar comprehensive and have stopped maintaining it.

I've started maintaining a calendar of events and volunteer opportunities around GA involving linux and other free software. I'm currently subscribed to the ALE, CHUGALUG, LUG@GT, GA State's Students for Open Source, GA Ubuntu LoCo, Atlanta "Pragmatic" Linux Meetup Group, and Free IT Athens mailing lists. I'm also subscribed to the LCLUE, MGALUG, SAVLUG, ATLOSUG, and OSSAtlanta rss feeds. Please leave a comment if you know of other places I should monitor for events or have an event you want publicized. Here are links to the calendar [html](http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=fa98uo7pfe9m96qhlghm84jg4g%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/New_York),
[xml](http://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/fa98uo7pfe9m96qhlghm84jg4g%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic), and
[ical](http://www.google.com/calendar/ical/fa98uo7pfe9m96qhlghm84jg4g%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics) formats.
