I've installed and enabled the [OpenID plugin for dokuwiki](http://www.splitbrain.org/blog/2007-01/09-openid_for_dokuwiki). Anyone with an [OpenID](http://openid.net/) ([more](http://dev.aol.com/aol-and-63-million-openids) [people](http://www.livejournal.com/openid/) than you might think) should be able to use it to log in. I'm just doing my part for non-evil federated identity management.

UPDATE: Due to spam, you must log in with OpenID or email me and request a local account in order to post comments.
