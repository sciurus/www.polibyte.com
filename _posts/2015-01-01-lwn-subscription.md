I just renewed my subscription to [LWN](https://lwn.net/) for another year. While it's true that I could read their content for free a week after it's released, LWN's reporting is so much better than anything else out there that I want to help provide the financing to continue it. It would be terrible to see them go the way of [The H](http://www.h-online.com/news/item/The-H-is-closing-down-1920027.html). If your livelihood depends in some way on Linux or the broader open source software ecosystem and you're not already a LWN reader, peruse their [weekly edition archives](https://lwn.net/Archives/) and consider subscribing too.
