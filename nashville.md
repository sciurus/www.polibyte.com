When I worked for Eventbrite, I frequently had the opportunity to show
coworkers from San Francisco or Mendoza around Nashville. I thought I would
share some of my recommendations for visitors. Fair warning that these are
biased towards places near the Eventbrite office or near my former house in
East Nashville.

* BBQ at Peg Leg Porker (get the dry rub ribs) or Martin's (try the brisket)
* Meat & 3 lunch at Arnolds
* Family-style southern dinner at Monell's
* Hot Chicken anywhere, as long as the restarurant only serves hot chicken
* Ramen at Two Ten Jack
* Coffee or beer and board games at Bongo East / Game Point
* Kombucha or tea at High Garden
* Ice cream at Jeni's
* Doughnuts at 5 Daughters
* Kolaches at Yeast Nashville
* Bluegrass at Station Inn
* Karaoke at Santa's Pub
* Visiting one of our [many breweries](http://www.nashvillescene.com/food-drink/cover-story/article/20830305/beer-here-a-map-of-nashville-breweries) (Smith & Lentz and Bearded Iris top my list)
* Shopping at the Idea Hatchery or Fatherland Shoppes
* Watching the tourists on Broadway
* If you need to get some work done, camping out at Portland Brew

If you want to know what's happening around town, pick up a copy of the
[Nashville Scene](http://www.nashvillescene.com/). If you're specifically interested in tech events, check out

Here is [another](https://www.pytennessee.org/2019/01/17/things-to-do-in-nashville/) good list of recommendations from the PyTennesse organizers, and here is [one](https://github.com/websages/nashville) from my friends at The Bikeshed.
