I frequently have the opportunity to show coworkers from San Francisco or Mendoza around Nashville.
Realizing that we'd have out-of-town speakers for
[DevOpsDays](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2016-nashville/welcome/), I thought I would share some of my
recommendations for visitors. Fair warning that these are biased towards places near the Eventbrite office or near my
house in East Nashville.

* BBQ at Peg Leg Porker (get the dry rub ribs)
* Meat & 3 lunch at Arnolds
* Family-style southern dinner at Monell's
* Hot Chicken anywhere (but I'm partial to Pepperfire)
* Biscuit sandwiches at Biscuit Love
* Ramen at Two Ten Jack
* Coffee snobbery at Barista Parlor
* Coffee practicality (and plenty of power and wifi) at Portland Brew
* Kombucha or tea at High Garden
* Ice cream at Jeni's
* Doughnuts at 5 Daughters
* Bluegrass at Station Inn
* Music and beer at The 5 Spot
* Karaoke at Santa's Pub
* Visiting one of our [many breweries](http://www.nashvillescene.com/food-drink/cover-story/article/20830305/beer-here-a-map-of-nashville-breweries)
* Shopping at the Idea Hatchery or Fatherland Shoppes
* Watching the tourists on Broadway

If you want to know what's happening around town, pick up a copy of the
[Nashville Scene](http://www.nashvillescene.com/). If you're specifically interested in tech events, check out
[cal.nashvl.org](http://cal.nashvl.org/) and consider joining [NashDev](http://nashdev.com/) on Slack.

Here is [another](https://github.com/websages/nashville) good list of recommendations from my friends at The Bikeshed.
